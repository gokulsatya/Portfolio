							<h3>ToadBud: Secure Web Analysis Chrome Extension</h3>
							<p>
							    Developed a Chrome extension that leverages the VirusTotal API to analyze URLs, IP addresses, and file hashes for potential security threats. 
								The tool provides instant threat assessments and educational security insights, helping users make informed decisions about web resources. 
								Built using JavaScript, Chrome Extensions API, and Tailwind CSS, featuring a modern UI with real-time analysis capabilities and secure API integration.

							<h3>Implemented Network Defense for Luna Bags</h3>
								<p>                                                                                                                                  
									Installed and configured Apache web server in Luna Bags' DMZ to host a generic website accessible via port 80.
									Enhanced security by implementing HTTPS and TLS protocols through the creation and installation of a web certificate.
									Developed and enforced firewall policies on the router based on access control policies to regulate traffic between the DMZ and internal network.
									Strengthened threat detection capabilities by deploying Snort for intrusion detection and Splunk as a SIEM tool to monitor network traffic.

							<h3>ICMP Redirect Attack Case Study   </h3>
							<p>                                                                                                                                                
								Conducted comprehensive analysis on ICMP Redirect Attack in a virtualized lab environment, demonstrating successful execution using Scapy Python library.
								Investigated mitigation strategies, including disabling ICMP redirects, network filtering, monitoring, and traffic integrity measures.
								Performed additional experiments to analyze attack behavior under different scenarios, such as remote IP redirection and router configuration changes.
								Documented findings, insights, and recommendations in a detailed report, emphasizing potential risks and importance of robust network security.
							</p>
							<h3>Foolish Firewall Configurations Challenge (pfSense) </h3>
							<p>
								Configured network firewall using NAT and Iptables to allow essential traffic (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH), enforced an implicit deny rule, and aligned TCP/IP routers and switches to enhance network administration security.
								Established precise inbound rules on server host firewalls (Ubuntu, Windows, Linux) via iptables and Windows Firewall, limiting access to required ports (MySQL, SSH, Samba), enhancing overall system defense technology.
							</p>
							<h3>EPRS(Electricity Plan Recommendation System)</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>EPRS is based on a Collaborative Filtering strategy and it is built using CF algorithms like KNN and SVM.
									It is developed using Python programming language and the concept of machine learning.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>essay build education</h3>
							<p>
							    I've built a tool for teachers that automatically grades and validates essays using modified versions of popular language models, specifically BERT and GPT-2. It's called Essaybuild education.
