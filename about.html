							    <p>Hi, I'm Gokul Sathiyamurthy</p>
							<p>I'm someone who thrives on challenges, whenever someone tells me something is impossible, my first thought is always "how can I make this possible?" This mindset drives me in both my personal and professional life.</p>
                                                        <p>I'm passionate about sports and physical fitness. Cricket is one of my favorite activities, and I also make time to hit the gym for at least an hour every day. </p>
                                                        <p>Staying active is an important part of my routine that helps me maintain both physical and mental balance.</p>
                                                        <p>On the football field, I play as a defender. While I didn't score many goals in that position, I took pride in preventing the opposition from scoring.</p>
                                                        <p>Thinking about it now, it's interesting how that defensive mindset may have influenced my career pathâ€”perhaps that's what drew me to become a Defender endpoint expert in cybersecurity!</p>
                                                        <p>When I'm not working or playing sports, I enjoy pushing my boundaries and taking on new challenges. I believe growth comes from stepping outside your comfort zone, whether that's in fitness, sports, or professional development.</p>
